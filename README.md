# MPC Tracking 4 Ground-Based Telescope
Herein, we provide the Matlab-based platform enabling the designing of the Tracking MPC for the Telescopio Nazionale Galieleo (TNG). 
The platform is in collaboration with the University of Naples Federico II, the Fundaci√≥n Galileo Galilei - INAF, as well as the OACN-INAF group of Naples.
Results are reported in [1].
